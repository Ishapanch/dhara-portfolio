                                                    normally would, doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures.
                                                    There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use
                                                    some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting until
                                                    normal life resumes.</p>
                                                <p>Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much
                                                    more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything
                                                    counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable
                                                    things about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so
                                                    we can remember them when it is all over.</p>
                                                <div className="quotebox">
                                                    <div className="icon">
                                                        <i className="icon-quote-left"></i>
                                                    </div>
                                                    <p>Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in
                                                        places in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new
                                                        seems always exactly what our photography needed, as shooting
                                                        away from home consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.

                                                <p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the
                                                    sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the
                                                    motorcar. Other things that are different at the moment will be
                                                    queues to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to
                                                    show how far apart we should be.</p>
                                                <p>Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and
                                                    then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where
                                                    one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
                                                    ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on
                                                    or off.</p>
                                                <p>The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
                                                    to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different
                                                    angles, with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move
                                                    to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house
                                                    again.</p>
